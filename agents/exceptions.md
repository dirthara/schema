# Exceptions

Exceptions in Dirthara follow the same convention as PHP's built-in exceptions. Each package has a base exception that 
extends from `Exception`. All exceptions thrown by the Dirthara package extend from this base exception.

The package base exception accepts an optional `array<string, mixed> $context` as
the fourth constructor argument, after message, code, and previous. It exposes
this data through `getContext(): array` and stores it in a protected property.
Specialized exceptions inherit this behaviour.

Exceptions carry data without logging themselves or depending on a logger package.
The application exception handler can pass `getContext()` to a PSR-3 logger,
adding the caught exception under the `exception` key. That key must contain the
caught exception even if context already contains an `exception` entry.

Include useful diagnostic metadata, such as the connection name, driver, and
operation. Do not include passwords, credential-bearing DSNs, or raw query
parameter values in context.

When a dependency can throw, catch the exception types it documents and rethrow
them as a specialized exception from this package. Pass the original as
`previous` and attach the operation's context. A caller should never need the
dependency in a `catch` block to handle a failure this package caused.

Catch the specific types, not `Throwable`. A `TypeError` or a `LogicException`
is a bug in this package rather than a failure of the operation, and turning one
into a domain exception hides it.

An exception that is already a Dirthara exception from this same package is not
rewrapped. Add what you know with `addContext()` and rethrow it, so its specific
type survives for the caller. An exception from another Dirthara package is
wrapped like any other dependency's: which package this one is built on is not
something its callers should have to catch.

A dependency's message can carry a DSN or credentials. The prohibition on
credentials applies to the message as much as to the context, so do not copy one
verbatim without knowing what it can contain.
